(We) assert that the work we submitted is 100% our own. We have not received any
part from any other student in the class, nor have we give parts of it for use to others.
Nor have we used code from other sources: Courses taught previously at this university,
courses taught at other universities, various bits of code found on the internet, etc.
We realize that should our code be found to contain code from other sources, that a
formal case shall be opened against us with משמעת ועדת ,in pursuit of disciplinary
action.

Please be careful to check your work multiple times. Because of the size of the class, we cannot
handle appeals to recheck your work in case you forget or fail to follow these instructions precisely.
Specifically, before you submit your final version, please take the time to unpack the archive, and
make sure your code loads and runs with the above directory structure. For example, make sure
your code can access the file pc.scm!
